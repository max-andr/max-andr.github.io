I'll give a talk at ELLIS Mathematics of Deep Learning about our ICML'22 paper [Towards Understanding Sharpness-Aware Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06232) on **28 Oct, 3 pm CET**. The zoom link is available in [this google group](https://groups.google.com/g/ellis-mathematics-of-deep-learning/).
