**Going to ICML 2023 in Hawaii to present [SGD with Large Step Sizes Learns Sparse Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05337) and [A Modern Look at the Relationship Between Sharpness and Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07011) at the main track and [Sharpness-Aware Minimization Leads to Low-Rank Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16292) at a [workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/hidimlearning/). Feel free to ping me if you want to chat!**
