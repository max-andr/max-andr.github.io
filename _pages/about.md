**Short bio.** I'm a fifth-year PhD student in computer science at EPFL 🇨🇭 advised by [Nicolas Flammarion](https://people.epfl.ch/nicolas.flammarion). My research is supported by the [Google](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/) and [Open Phil AI](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/open-phil-ai-fellowship-2022-class/) PhD Fellowships. I did my MSc at Saarland University and the University of Tübingen, and interned at Adobe Research. 
<!-- My current research mainly focuses on developing a better understanding of the training dynamics of deep networks and their adversarial robustness.  -->
<!-- **Formal bio.** Maksym Andriushchenko is a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland. He obtained his MSc from Saarland University, Germany. His research mainly focuses on how to better understand the training dynamics of deep networks and make machine learning algorithms adversarially robust. Maksym has published eleven papers at major machine learning and computer vision conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ECCV, etc). His research is supported by the Google and OpenPhil PhD Fellowships. -->


**Research interests.**
<!-- My primary research goal is to understand generalization in deep learning. I'm interested in the training dynamics of commonly used algorithms (e.g., [SGD with large step sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05337), [sharpness-aware minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06232), [fine-tuning language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04884)), adversarial robustness ([formal guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08475), [square attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00049), [fast adversarial training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02617), [RobustBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09670)), and out-of-distribution generalization ([curious ReLU properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05720), generalization to image [corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02325) and [digital manipulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12860)).  -->
<!-- My primary research goal is to *understand generalization in deep learning*. Towards this goal, I've worked on adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, implicit regularization, and sharpness-aware minimization. These days, I'm looking more into optimization and generalization properties of language models. My full publication list is available [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZNtuJYoAAAAJ). -->
My primary research goal is to understand robustness and generalization in deep learning. Toward this goal, I’ve worked on adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, implicit regularization, and sharpness-aware minimization. These days, I’m focusing almost entirely on various aspects of large language models, such as optimization, alignment, memorization, and robustness. My complete publication list is available [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZNtuJYoAAAAJ).


**On Ukraine.** Since I'm from Ukraine, I'm often asked about the situation in my country and how one can help. The most effective way is to donate to *local Ukrainian organization helping on the ground*, e.g., see [this list](https://standforukraine.com/) which includes both trusted military and humanitarian organizations. You can also host displaced scholars and students from Ukraine, e.g., see the [#ScienceForUkraine project](https://scienceforukraine.eu/) where I'm involved as a volunteer. You can also help simply by spreading the word about the war and going to demonstrations in your city. It's very important that we don't normalize [annexations of territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine), [numerous war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), [mass deportations](https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-reports-of-mass-deportations-recall-russias-dark-history-of-forcible-relocations-190272), and [nuclear threats](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/09/russias-nuclear-threats/671571/). Otherwise, we'll end up in a world we don't really want to be in.
