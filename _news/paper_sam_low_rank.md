**Our new paper [Sharpness-Aware Minimization Leads to Low-Rank Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16292) is available online!** 
We investigate the low-rank effect of SAM which occurs in a variety of settings (regression, classification, contrastive learning) and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers).
