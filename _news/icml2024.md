Going to ICML 2024 in Vienna to present [Long Is More for Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04833) at the main track and also [Adaptive Jailbreaking Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151) and [JailbreakBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01318) at the NextGenAISafety workshop. Feel free to ping me if you want to chat about robustness and generalization in LLMs!
