Our paper [ARIA: Adversarially Robust Image Attribution for Content Provenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12860) is accepted to the [CVPR'22 Workshop on Media Forensics](https://sites.google.com/view/mediaforensics2022/home). One of (a few?) applications where $$\ell_p$$ adversarial robustness is well-motivated from the security point of view.
