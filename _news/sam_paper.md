Our paper [Towards Understanding Sharpness-Aware Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06232) got accepted to **ICML'22**! We shed some light on why the existing justifications behind SAM are incomplete, what's the role of m-sharpness on very simple models, and study  other curious properties of SAM empirically.
